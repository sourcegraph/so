# Sourcegraph Q&A
Internal StackOverflow (Q&amp;A) for Sourcegraph devs

This is a pilot of improving the dev docs in a lean way.

Why a new repo:
 - Don't want to pollute the main docs with this pilot
 - Found no better place to put it
 - Wanted a place that's indexed by Sourcegraph

If successful, the contents of this repo might be moved to the [docs site](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/).
